# Bearbytes C++ utils

This repository contains various utilities written using non-std C++23.
Furthermore, this repository stores examples of tooling configurations which
may serve as look-up resources when working on new projects.

The reason for existence of this repository is twofold:
- gather utilities which are useful in embedded programming,
- learn details of some useful std objects.
